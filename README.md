Also be sure to join us in the public [Hapi Hour Slack Channel](https://t.co/RLLcGIGmRZ) to talk all things hapi!

Another great way to learn more is to get your hands dirty. Watch the repo and see if you can answer [new issues](https://github.com/hapijs/discuss/issues) faster than the maintainers!
It's a great way to learn, even if it takes you weeks to find the first issue you can answer at all! I promise you will learn something interesting!
